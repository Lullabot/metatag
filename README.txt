Metatag
-------
This module allows you to automatically provide structured metadata, aka "meta
tags", about your website and web pages.

In the context of search engine optimization, providing an extensive set of
meta tags may help improve your site's & pages' ranking, thus may aid with
achieving a more prominent display of your content within search engine
results. Additionally, using meta tags can help control the summary content
that is used within social networks when visitors link to your site,
particularly the Open Graph submodule for use with Facebook, Pinterest,
LinkedIn, etc (see below).

This version of the module only works with the v8.0.x releases of Drupal.
